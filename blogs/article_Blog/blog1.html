            <h3>What is the biggest problem in UB ?</h3>
            <p>
                Ulaanbaatar is the capital of Mongolia and has almost half of its population. Over the last few years, there has been rapid development of either the environment or problems. I will try to explain the problem of UB more clearly. First of all, the issue
                of headache in Mongolia and globally is air pollution that shadows human development. UB is the world's second-largest emitter of smoke and four times its normal size. For example, I heard that my sister was born in UB a week ago. Since
                hearing the news, I was very happy with my wish to be my younger sister. But my younger sister is not normal therefore I went to the hospital with my sister, and the doctor told me that air pollution was affecting my sister, therefore
                my sister should be in the countryside with fresh air. When I heard it, I was shocked. In addition, Air pollution harmful affects the health of the population and increases the incidence of respiratory cardiovascular, allergic disease,
                genetic disorder, congenital malformation and cancers, and incidence of childhood immunodeficiency and growth. the findings of scientists and researchers have shown. I am sad because air pollution is threatening Mongolia's future. The
                Second big problem is mining. Despite desertification only in the southern part of Mongolia, it has been increasing rapidly due to mining in recent years. In other words, more than seventy-five percent of the country's territory is affected
                by desertification. Mining can have harmful effects on the surroundings, groundwater, and people. The result can be an unnaturally high concentration of some chemicals, such as mercury. Mercury is easily soluble in water and is easily
                absorbed into the human body, and is the main cause of cancer. Therefore artisanal gold miners are injured by their health, and their children are affected by genes . It is very dangerous. In conclusion, the most important issues in Mongolia
                are air pollution and mining. The health issues of Mongolian people are of comparable value. It is important for every Mongolian to enter into solving problems.
